## Description
    
The purpose of this projext is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. The site is to be built completely from scratch and will be deployed to Heroku. The app will follow MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. The goal of building this is to become more comfortable using these technologies.
